def flip(m: ndarray, axis: NdShapeLike | None = None) -> ndarray:
    """
    Reverse the order of elements in an array along the given axis.

    The shape of the array is preserved, but the elements are reordered.

    Parameters
    ----------
    m : array_like
        Input array.
    axis : None or int or tuple[int], optional
         Axis or axes along which to flip over. The default, axis=None, will
         flip over all of the axes of the input array.  If axis is negative it
         counts from the last to the first axis.

         If axis is a tuple of ints, flipping is performed on all of the axes
         specified in the tuple.

    Returns
    -------
    out : array_like
        A new array that is constructed from `m` with the entries of axis
        reversed.

def flipud(m: ndarray) -> ndarray:
    """
    Reverse the order of elements along axis 0 (up/down).

    For a 2-D array, this flips the entries in each column in the up/down
    direction. Rows are preserved, but appear in a different order than before.

    Parameters
    ----------
    m : array_like
        Input array.

    Returns
    -------
    out : array_like
        A new array that is constructed from `m` with rows reversed.

@add_boilerplate("m")
def fliplr(m: ndarray) -> ndarray:
    """
    Reverse the order of elements along axis 1 (left/right).

    For a 2-D array, this flips the entries in each row in the left/right
    direction. Columns are preserved, but appear in a different order than
    before.

    Parameters
    ----------
    m : array_like
        Input array, must be at least 2-D.

    Returns
    -------
    f : ndarray
        A new array that is constructed from `m` with the columns reversed.
