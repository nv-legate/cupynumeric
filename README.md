[![Build Nightly release package](https://github.com/nv-legate/cupynumeric.internal/actions/workflows/ci-gh-nightly-release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nv-legate/cupynumeric.internal/actions/workflows/ci-gh-nightly-release.yml)

# cuPyNumeric

cuPyNumeric is a library that aims to provide a distributed and accelerated
drop-in replacement for [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) built on top of the
[Legate](https://github.com/nv-legate/legate) framework.

With cuPyNumeric you can write code productively in Python, using the familiar
NumPy API, and have your program scale with no code changes from single-CPU
computers to multi-node-multi-GPU clusters.

For example, you can run
[the final example of the Python CFD course](https://github.com/barbagroup/CFDPython/blob/master/lessons/15_Step_12.ipynb)
completely unmodified on 2048 A100 GPUs in a
[DGX SuperPOD](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-superpod/)
and achieve good weak scaling.

cuPyNumeric works best for programs that have very large arrays of data
that cannot fit in the memory of a single GPU or a single node and need
to span multiple nodes and GPUs. While our implementation of the current
NumPy API is still incomplete, programs that use unimplemented features
will still work (assuming enough memory) by falling back to the
canonical NumPy implementation.

## Installation

Pre-built cuPyNumeric packages are available from
[conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) on the
[legate channel](https://anaconda.org/legate/cupynumeric) and from
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/nvidia-cupynumeric/). See
https://docs.nvidia.com/cupynumeric/latest/installation.html for details about
different install configurations, or building cuPyNumeric from source.

📌 **Note**

Packages are offered for Linux (x86_64 and aarch64) and macOS (aarch64, pip
wheels only), supporting Python versions 3.11 to 3.13. Windows is only supported
through WSL.
