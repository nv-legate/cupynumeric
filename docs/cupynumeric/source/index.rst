NVIDIA cuPyNumeric
==================

cuPyNumeric is a library that aims to provide a distributed and accelerated
drop-in replacement for `NumPy`_ built on top of the `Legate`_ framework.

With cuPyNumeric you can write code productively in Python, using the familiar
NumPy API, and have your program scale with no code changes from single-CPU
computers to multi-node-multi-GPU clusters.

For example, you can run `the final example of the Python CFD course`_
completely unmodified on 2048 A100 GPUs in a `DGX SuperPOD`_ and achieve
good weak scaling.
